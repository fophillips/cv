                <h4>News Automation Infrastructure</h4>
                <p>Leading a team of four engineers building Bloomberg's
                automated news platform, which is used by a team of content
                engineers to generate news stories automatically. Developing the
                product in coordination with multiple stakeholders balancing new
                features for clients with improving developer experience for the
                content engineers. The platform is a real-time distributed
                system built with a combination of Python 3 and TypeScript, and
                runs hundreds of different types of automated story which are
                triggered by market moving events and collect data from over one
                hundred data sources and APIs.</p>

                <p>A project to integrate automated news content into manually
                written stories was recently launched to good reception from
                reporters in the newsroom. The stories produced with this are
                amongst the most popular of all news stories on the Bloomberg
                Professional Service with tens of thousands of reads every
                day.</p>

                <p>Experienced as a hiring manager for both senior and junior
                candidates, have conducted hundreds of interviews for different
                roles across the company. Now specialising in interviews of
                candidates from diverse backgrounds outside of the Computer
                Science.</p>

                <h4>News Automation Infrastructure</h4>
                <p>Joined the News Automation team as a senior software engineer
                and lead the technical direction of the team. Designed and
                developed the team's priority queuing system based on RabbitMQ,
                the story aggregation system to link similar automated stories,
                and many other projects.</p>

                <p>Planned the Python 2 to 3 migration of all news automation
                code. A 18-month project across multiple teams to migrate over
                1.5 million lines of Python 2 to Python 3 without service
                disruption. Communicated the importance of the project with
                stakeholders to get it initially prioritised and to keep them
                engaged and informed throughout.</p>

                <p>Coached and mentored junior members of the team, training
                them to lead on projects design sustainable systems.</p>

                <p>Managed multiple clusters of Linux machines in Bloomberg's
                datacentres to run the team's applications, including budgeting
                for and provisioning hardware.</p>

                <p>Maintained numerical models in production to predict power
                and gas supply and demand across Europe implemented in Python.
                Worked with counterparts in the product team to take their
                models and run them reliably in production. Built infrastructure
                and tooling for the models to publish their results in realtime
                to clients through the Bloomberg Professional Service and
                directly to Excel.</p>

                <p>Commodities was one of the first teams in the company to
                adopt Python, developed standards within the team that were
                adopted throughout the company and maintained a library that was
                used by thousands of engineers.</p>

                <p>Wrote and maintained real time pricing engines built in C++
                to publish commodity prices to clients. Pioneered migrating
                these from legacy big-iron systems to commodity Linux
                hardware.</p>
