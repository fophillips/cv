                <p>
                    As the Engineering Manager overseeing the Data Platform and
                    Data Test Automation teams at BenchSci, I drive the
                    organization towards the forefront of DataOps, DevOps,
                    automated testing, and efficient data delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I established the Data Platform team in 2022, assembling a
                    distributed team of over ten skilled software and data
                    engineers. I expanded the team's mandate to take ownership
                    of BenchSci's DataOps, significantly enhancing the data
                    delivery process. This facilitated a twofold increase in
                    data deployment frequency by enhancing automation, improving
                    test coverage, and optimizing company-wide data pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently leading the development of a new event-driven
                    platform, enabling BenchSci to harness the latest
                    advancements in generative AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Took over leadership of the Data Test Automation team in
                    January 2024, to ensure the organization meets its data
                    quality objectives. I embed experts from my team within
                    other teams to provide guidance and implement testing best
                    practices, bolstering data quality across the organization.
                    I am leading the rollout of a data reliability engineering
                    approach to data quality to enable continuous data delivery
                    to customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I foster a culture of excellence, enabling team members to
                    achieve professional milestones through coaching and
                    mentorship. I successfully mentor high-performing
                    individuals, guiding them to promotions and leadership
                    roles, while also assisting underperforming team members
                    through performance improvement plans and candid
                    conversations. I ensure alignment of  individual career
                    goals with company outcomes, fostering a collaborative and
                    results-driven environment.

                <h4>News Automation Infrastructure</h4>
                <p>
                    Led an agile team of four engineers in constructing
                    Bloomberg's automated news platform, utilized by a team of
                    content engineers to automatically generate news stories.
                    Developed the product in coordination with multiple
                    stakeholders, striking a balance between introducing new
                    features for clients and enhancing the developer experience for
                    content engineers. The platform was a real-time distributed
                    system built with a combination of Python 3 and TypeScript,
                    running hundreds of different types of automated stories
                    triggered by market-moving events and collecting data from over
                    one hundred data sources and APIs.

                    engineer and led the technical direction of the team.
                    Designed and developed the team's priority queuing system
                    based on RabbitMQ, the story aggregation system to link
                    similar automated stories, and many other projects.

                <p>
                    Led the Python 2 to 3 migration of all news automation
                    code. A 18-month project across multiple teams to migrate
                    over 1.5 million lines of Python 2 to Python 3 without
                    service disruption. Communicated the importance of the
                    project with stakeholders to get it initially prioritized
                    and to keep them engaged and informed throughout.
